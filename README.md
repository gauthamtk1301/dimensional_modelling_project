# Data Lakehouse Project

Welcome to the **Data Lakehouse Project** repository! 🚀  
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a modern data lakehouse architecture on Databricks, integrating real-time data ingestion, streaming ETL, and dimensional modeling for analytics.

⚙️  Key Features

**Real-time streaming ETL**:
Ingests and processes data in near real time as soon as files arrive in the source directories.

**Data quality and enrichment**:
Standardizes, cleans, and enriches CRM and ERP data before persisting to Delta tables.

**Slowly Changing Dimensions**:
Implements Slowly Changing Dimensions (Type 2) for tracking historical changes in the silver layer.

**Lakehouse architecture**:
Combines the flexibility of a data lake with the reliability and performance of a data warehouse.

**Dimensional modelling**:
Gold layer is modeled as a star schema for ease of querying and understandings.

**Deployment**:
Leverages Github Actions and Databricks Asset bundles for automated deployments.
